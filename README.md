# Agio

An unofficial Python GUI for Coinbase Exchange.

The immediate goal is to reproduce the main Exchange window:

- [x] Trade History table
- [X] Fills table
- [X] Open Orders table
- [ ] Price chart
- [ ] Order Book chart
- [X] Order Book table
- [ ] Available Balance table
- [ ] Order entry
- [ ] Top info ribbon


Agio: the premium on a better sort of money when it is given in exchange for an inferior sort.
